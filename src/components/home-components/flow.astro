    Introducing Flow, the latest synthetic grass technology that prevents
    puddles and infestations
  </h2>
  <p>
    Many inferior artificial turf products that exist in the market are
    susceptible to forming puddles after a rainy weather. Not resolving the
    problem right away will eventually lead to a mosquito infestation. These
    stagnant water pools create a perfect breeding ground for mosquitoes, which
    can pose health risks.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Tackling this issue requires regular maintenance checks to identify areas
    where water tends to accumulate or installing a drainage system beneath the
    system.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, our artificial grass product Flow avoids this requirement and
    resolves the issue of puddles.
  </p>
  <p>
    This new turf technology has more porous holes that allows water to be
    absorbed better. Thus, you can say goodbye to stagnant puddles of water and
    mosquitoes.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is also cleaner than regular artificial turf because any unwanted
    material, such as dog urine, washes off easier.
  </p>
  <p>
    Flow is also retains less heat, compared to regular fake grass, which has
    difficulty in cooling itself naturally especially in hot summers.
