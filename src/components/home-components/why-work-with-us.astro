    Why work with us rather than other artificial turf installers in Los
    Angeles?
  </h2>
  <h3>Flexibility</h3>
  <p>
    If you have any last minute changes even if a project has already started,
    we will adjust our procedures to make them happen.
  </p>
  <h3>Resourcefulness</h3>
  <p>
    If you require a specific material that is hard to find, we will demonstrate
    our resourcefulness.
  </p>
  <h3>Affordability</h3>
  <p>If your budget is tight, we can negotiate ways to maneuver around it.</p>
  <h3>Landscape design expertise</h3>
  <p>
    We want to share our passion for landscape design with our community, which
    can benefit from our knowledge and years of experience in artificial turf
    installation.
  </p>
  <p>
    In every project, it is our mission to help clients achieve what they
    envisioned their yards to look like.
  </p>
  <h3>Pavers and cement work</h3>
  <p>
    We also include installing pavers and cement work when installing synthetic
    grass. This helps to take our designs to the next level.
  </p>
  <h3>Securing your investment</h3>
  <p>
    We offer a very generous policy. To elaborate, your artificial turf will
    have a 15 year warranty with the manufacturer and 1 year turf installation
    warranty with us. This means that if the product has a defect, it will be
    replaced.
