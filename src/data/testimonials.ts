      "I'm happy with how they get the job done in one day (front yard turf installation). Helen listens and communicate well to her client. She is reliable and trustworthy. She doesn’t charge much unlike the others I invited for an estimate. Highly recommended. You guys won’t regret it.",

    testimonial:
      "Loved that they showed up in a mask. My previous gardener disappeared. I have been thinking n the market for a new gardener for about a month. I searched Yelp twice and last night I finally made contact with multiple gardeners. I quickly learned that I do not have a mow & blow type of yard. After multiple exchanges with multiple gardeners, the Hardrock team came by and gave me an estimate. Chris was the translator for Gabino. My service needs have conditions. 1) Rinse the blades of the lawnmower twice: before starting and before moving to either front or back. Rationale is to limit cross contamination from the weeds of others and/or my St. Augustine. Before hiring a gardener 9 years ago, my lawn was fairly nice. Over time, my lawn became full of weeds and crab grass. The issue was that the gardener was going from lawn to lawn. The seeds from the lawns of others ended up destroying my lawn. The Team agreed to rinse before and again at the exchange from back to front or front to back. I have multiple flowerbeds, newly planted boxwood trees, and prefab concrete stones. I am fully aware of the amount of detail that is needed to maintain my lawn, which is why I was in search of a qualified gardener. I needed a gardener who k owe about lawns and also knows the difference between a fern and a weed. Gabino gave me his price; $120 a month for weekly service. Knowing that no-weekly rate is $60 a month, I found this price to be fair. I asked when they could start? They said now. My last gardener only accepted cash or check. It's nice finding a gardener who accepts electronic forms of payment. Gabino speaks Spanish. Chris speaks English. Gabino is very knowledgeable about lawns. He let me know that my newly installed sod is being over watered, which is why it's turning brown. He suggested that I reduce watering to every other day vs. daily. He noticed that I have a large dog and recognized the worn path from my dog. Gabino suggested that I resume blocking off the back lawn, allowing additional time for the newly planted sod to mature.  These pics were taken today, after today's lawn maintenance service. I am happy with the results. I am thankful for Yelp, who provided me with a resource to find a good gardener. Chris and Gabino, I will see you guys next week.",

      "Best experience I have had with a contractor. On time, finished ahead of schedule, fixed any concerns, even priced additional work fairly. My artificial turf looks amazing. Helen was extremely courteous and professional. It's a small company feel, and they're were understandable snags, but it helped to see Helen on site almost every day, to make sure any concerns were addressed. I would use her company again without hesitation.",

      "Wow, these guys came out at 7 am-ish on the HOTTEST day of the month so far. They did a FABULOUS job by clearing up the front yard of all the weeds, trimming the side brush back from the overgrowth from the neighbors fence ( ivy and tall bush trees) then they attacked and removed all of the tall weeds, cleaned up all the walkways and were so nice! So good at what they do!!!! Highly recommend!",
